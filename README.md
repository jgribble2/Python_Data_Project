OVERVIEW 

Welcome to my analysis of the current job market, focusing specifically on data scientist roles! This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It dives into the top-paying and most in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysis.

The data is sourced from Luke barousse's Python Course which provides the foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary for data scientist roles.

QUESTIONS

Below are the questions I look to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in-demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for data scientists?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for data scientists?
4. What are the optimal skills for data scientists to learn? (Skills with both high demand AND high pay)
